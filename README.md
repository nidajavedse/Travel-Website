# Travel-Website
This project is a dynamic travel website built on the Angular framework, providing an engaging and user-friendly experience. The front-end is crafted with a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with Angular enhancing interactivity and responsiveness. On the backend, PHP is employed for server-side scripting, seamlessly integrating with MySQL for efficient data storage and retrieval. The incorporation of AJAX enhances the user experience by handling form data submissions asynchronously. This travel website project showcases the power of Angular for creating a modern and responsive front-end, while the PHP-MySQL stack ensures robust server-side functionality and data management.
